// You are in charge of the cake for your niece's birthday and have decided the cake will have one candle for each year of her total age.
// When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones.
// Your task is to find out how many candles she can successfully blow out.

// For example, if your niece is turning 4 years old, and the cake will have 4 candles of height 4, 4, 1, 3, she will be able to blow out 2 candles successfully,
// since the tallest candles are of height 4 and there are 4 such candles.
